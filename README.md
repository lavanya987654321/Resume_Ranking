# AI Resume Screening & Candidate Ranking System
 An AI-powered resume screening system that ranks candidates based on job descriptions using NLP techniques like TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity.
###  Project Overview
Recruiters often struggle with manually screening hundreds of resumes. This project automates the resume ranking process using AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP), saving time and ensuring fair candidate evaluation.

🔹 Extracts text from PDF resumes

🔹 Compares resumes with job descriptions

🔹 Ranks resumes based on relevance

🔹 Displays results in a simple web app

### Features
✅ AI-powered ranking using TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity

✅ Bulk resume upload (Supports multiple PDFs)

✅ Easy-to-use web interface (Built with Streamlit)

✅ Fast & unbiased resume screening

✅ Open-source & lightweight

### How It Works
1️. Enter the job description in the text box.

2️. Upload resumes (PDF format).

3️. The system extracts text and converts it into numerical form (TF-IDF).

4️. Cosine Similarity measures how closely resumes match the job description.

5️. Resumes are ranked and displayed in an interactive web interface.

### Technologies Used
-Python 🐍

-Streamlit 🌐 (Web UI)

-PyPDF2 📄 (Extracts text from PDFs)

-Scikit-learn 🤖 (TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity)
